Clone the directory to your local and get in REST file to use the following in terminal:

```
npm init
npm install
npm install express --save
```

after these steps, use:

```
npm run start
```
in terminal. Now you must be able to see the Web Service at "http://localhost:3000/".

If you are getting missing package errors, download them by necessary commands which you can find by Google.

Best.
